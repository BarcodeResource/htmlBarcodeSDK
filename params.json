{"name":"Htmlbarcodesdk","tagline":"HTML Barcode SDK is a HTML and Javascript barcode generation Software Development Kit (SDK). ","body":"The HTML Barcode SDK is an Open Source HTML and Javascript barcode generation Software Development Kit. It creates commonly-used 1 dimensional barcodes like Code 128, Code39, UPCA, EAN13 and others using pure Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and can be used in a wide variety of browsers without additional browser plug-ins. \r\n\r\nThe SDK does not employ the use of graphics image. Instead, it uses pure HTML tags/code for generating and printing the barcodes. This overcomes typical problems associated with the generation of images on the client (browser), e.g. limited support of the Data URI feature in specific versions of the browsers.
